       "In 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique features:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: Released in March 2025, this lightweight Python framework focuses on creating multi-agent workflows with comprehensive tracing and guardrails. It is compatible with over 100 different large language models (LLMs). ([jlcnews.com](https://www.jlcnews.com/post/the-best-ai-agents-in-2025-tools-frameworks-and-platforms-compared?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: Announced in April 2025, Google's ADK is a modular framework that integrates with the Google ecosystem, including Gemini and Vertex AI. It supports hierarchical agent compositions and requires minimal code for efficient development. ([jlcnews.com](https://www.jlcnews.com/post/the-best-ai-agents-in-2025-tools-frameworks-and-platforms-compared?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent Lightning**: Introduced in August 2025, Agent Lightning is a flexible and extensible framework that enables reinforcement learning-based training of LLMs for any AI agent. It achieves complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed through various methods. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF)**: Also from August 2025, PCF leverages LLMs and mathematical frameworks to guide the design of adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments. It enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through mathematically grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **GoalfyMax**: Introduced in July 2025, GoalfyMax is a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end multi-agent collaboration. It features a standardized Agent-to-Agent communication layer and an Experience Pack architecture, supporting robust, real-time strategy adaptation. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09497?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cognitive Kernel-Pro**: Launched in August 2025, Cognitive Kernel-Pro is a fully open-source, multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. It systematically investigates the curation of high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models and explores novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent robustness and performance. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n",
