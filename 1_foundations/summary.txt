Hi, I’m Soroush. I’m Iranian, born in 1999, and I currently live in Italy in the beautiful city of Messina. I love both Italian and Persian food, and I carry those two cultures with me in the way I live and what I enjoy. Right now I’m a data science student, focused on learning, growing as much as I can, and building the skills to make a real, positive impact on the world.
