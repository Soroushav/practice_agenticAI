       "1. Ordering/precedence constraints:\n",
       "   - Experiment A must be run **before** experiment D, but **not immediately before** D.\n",
       "   - Experiment B must be run **after** experiment E, but **not immediately after** E.\n",

(Formally: for any two distinct ordered pairs (X, Y) and (U, V) that are each in a “X before Y” relationship given by the rules, it is not allowed that pos(X) = pos(U) and pos(Y) = pos(V).)\n",

Experiment H is either the first or immediately after G, but not both. Experiment A must be before D but not immediately before, and B must be after E but not immediately after.
